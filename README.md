The Online Reservation System is designed to simplify the booking process for users by providing a user-friendly interface with essential fields required for online reservations. Any individual can easily navigate through this system. The core concept behind this project is to centralize data storage in a secure database, accessible to authorized personnel, thereby streamlining processes and alleviating the burdens faced by our valued customers.

This system comprises several key modules. Firstly, the Login Form ensures that only users with valid login credentials can access the system, guaranteeing security and privacy. Once inside, users can seamlessly make reservations through the Reservation System. Here, users input vital information such as their personal details, train preferences (where train names are automatically populated), class type, journey date, and departure and arrival locations. Upon completion, users simply press the insert button to confirm their reservation.

For those who need to cancel their tickets, the Cancellation Form provides an efficient solution. Passengers are required to input their unique PR number, which then retrieves all relevant information associated with that specific reservation. Should users wish to proceed with the cancellation, they can simply press the OK button, simplifying the cancellation process for a hassle-free experience.
